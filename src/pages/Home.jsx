                This project is based on the book <a href="https://www.roadtoreact.com/">The road to React</a> by Robin Wieruch.
            </p>
            <p>
                The book is a great resource for learning React and the project is a great way to get started with React.
                Each page of the app corresponds to a chapter or an element of the book.
